    "Our company was established in 2016. The main task of the production, at the first stage, was servicing of just one, but a large customer, who is still a regular partner till this day. We work every day to improve our technological line and increase the professional training of personnel. This approach allows us to receive a large number of new orders, in the confirmation of which, we already have a positive experience of serving wholesale orders not only from Ukraine, but also from several countries in Europe. We consider our strength not only the quality and speed, but also our cooperation and agreements with large Asian factories for the production of textiles. This allows us to get the best prices, which affects reduction in the final cost of products for the customer.",

    "We have been a customer of this manufacturer's products for 3 years. The basic order is a set of bed linen and pillowcases. I like the speed of order's execution and how promptly changes are made at our request in the ways of tailoring, packing, etc. I want to note that our cooperation saved for me not only time, but also a large amount of money that we spent on searching and buying cloth. NUVOLA managed for us to get the best price for the fabric from its supplier. I recommend this company for cooperation.",

  "alexandr_review":
    "At the end of 2017, we've decided to give part of the work for the sewing of bedding products to company NUVOLA. To fulfill the order, we used our own raw materials. We were satisfied with both speed and quality of tailoring. It was also surprising that the price of works was lower than we paid for our orders, which were much larger in volume. We plan to continue cooperation and increase the volume of the order.",
